## **3. Course Description**

This course provides an in-depth exploration of the techniques and algorithms used to analyze and mine large-scale graphs and networks. Students will learn about:
- Various types of graph data and their unique challenges in storage and processing  
- Core graph mining techniques (e.g., graph traversal, centrality measures, community detection)  
- Real-world applications including social network analysis, fraud detection, and recommendation systems  

By the end of the semester, students will be able to:
- Represent and store complex graph data efficiently  
- Apply key graph mining algorithms to extract meaningful insights  
- Utilize programming tools (e.g., Python’s NetworkX) for hands-on graph analysis and visualization

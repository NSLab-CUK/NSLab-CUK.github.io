# Introduction to Network Science Lab 
***

Network Sicence Lab at The Catholic University of Korea studies a broad range of theories and methodologies related to collecting, representing, and analyzing networked data. We deal with various artificial intelligence and machine learning models for networked data, including network embedding models and GCN(Graph Convolution Network). Recently, we have interest in self-supervised representation learning of dynamic heterogeneous networks and attributed networks by using multi-modal transformers.

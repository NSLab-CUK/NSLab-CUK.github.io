# Introduction to Network Science Lab 
***

Network Sicence Lab at The Catholic University of Korea studies a broad range of theories and methodologies related to collecting, representing, and analyzing networked data. We deal with various artificial intelligence and machine learning models for networked data, including network embedding models and GCN(Graph Convolution Network).

#Network Science Lab에서는 Network Embedding, GCN(Graph Convolution Network) 등과 관련된 인공지능 모델을 연구하며,
#이를 바탕으로 Social Network, Bibliographic Network, Traffic Flow, 기상 데이터 등의 다양한 Unstructured Data에 네트워크 분석 기법들을 적용하는 연구를 수행합니다.

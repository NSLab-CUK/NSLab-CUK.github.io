This year's colloquium will offer attendees the chance to learn from keynote speakers and panelists on a variety of topics, including career paths in academia, industry, and entrepreneurship, as well as the latest advances in AI research.

In addition to presentations and panel discussions, the colloquium will feature intensive and interactive mentoring sessions.

NS-CUK submitted one research paper to the IEEE TNSE (Transactions on Network Science and Engineering), which is one of the most prestigious journals in the field of network science, and was successfully accepted.

IEEE TNSE is a leading academic journal dedicated to publishing high-quality research on network theory, methods, and applications. 
This journal covers various aspects of network science, including network modeling, structural analysis, information diffusion, and applications across various domains.

This paper, accepted into the regular issue, presents a novel method for mitigating the degree bias problem in the message passing mechanism. Details of this paper are as follows:

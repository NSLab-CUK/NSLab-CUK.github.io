The undergraduate research assistants of NS@CUK have once again distinguished themselves in the 2023 CUK Competition on Data Analytics, securing the best award for the second consecutive year. [Jooho Lee](https://nslab-cuk.github.io/member/jhlee), [Ho Beom Kim](https://nslab-cuk.github.io/member/hbkim), and [Hyo Eun Lee](https://nslab-cuk.github.io/member/helee) crafted an artificial intelligence model and service that harvests information related to lectures, along with their ratings and reviews, from Everytime - a community service platform for university students. This information is then modeled into a knowledge graph and a graph neural network is employed to predict the ratings of the lectures. The presentation slides, technical report, source code, and data are available through the links below.

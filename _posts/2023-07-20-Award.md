The undergraduate research assistants of NS@CUK have once again distinguished themselves in the 2023 CUK Competition on Data Analytics, securing the best award for the second consecutive year. Jooho Lee, Ho Beom Kim, and Hyo Eun Lee crafted an artificial intelligence model and service that harvests information related to lectures, along with their ratings and reviews, from Everytime - a community service platform for university students. This information is then modeled into a knowledge graph and a graph neural network is employed to predict the ratings of the lectures. The presentation slides, technical report, source code, and data are available through the links below.
